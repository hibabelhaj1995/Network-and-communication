**TASK1: TCPAsk**
Task 1 focuses on developing a TCP client in Java named TCPClient. This client class facilitates communication with a server by establishing a TCP connection, sending data to the server, and receiving its response. The goal is to learn the fundamentals of TCP sockets, implement the client side of client-server communication, and handle any errors that may occur during this process. By using methods like `askServer`, the client can interact with the server in a straightforward and structured manner. A dynamic buffer for receiving data ensures efficient handling of the server's response, while various testing scenarios, such as Daytime and Whois, enable practical validation of the implementation. Finally, a correctly formatted zip file for submission ensures the solution can be evaluated properly.

**TASK2: TCPAsk Connections**
Task 2 extends the TCPClient class introduced in Task 1 to handle different server connection scenarios. It adds options for timeouts, data limits, and controlling connection shutdown. TCPAsk is also updated to support these new parameters. Testing involves interacting with various servers to verify implementation under different conditions. Submission follows the same format as Task 1. Evaluation checks the submission format and functionality through tests.

**TASK3: HTTPAsk Server**
Task 3 introduces HTTPAsk, a web server utilizing TCPClient from previous tasks. It receives HTTP requests with TCPClient parameters encoded in the query string, invokes TCPClient.askServer(), and returns the output as an HTTP response. Your task is to implement the HTTPAsk class with a main method serving as the server. It listens on a specified port, parses incoming HTTP GET requests, extracts TCPClient parameters, and generates valid HTTP responses. Submission follows the same format as previous tasks, and evaluation includes verifying the submission format and conducting tests to check functionality.

**TASK4: Concurrent HTTPAsk Server**

Task 4 requires transforming the HTTPAsk server from Task 3 into a concurrent server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously. Unlike Task 3, where clients were served one at a time, ConcHTTPAsk serves each client immediately upon contact without waiting for previous clients to finish. You'll utilize Java threading to achieve this concurrency, creating a new thread for each client. Your implementation involves defining a class that implements the Runnable interface, creating and starting threads to handle client requests concurrently. The submission format remains the same as previous tasks, with evaluation focusing on verifying concurrent functionality and conducting tests to ensure correct handling of multiple client connections.
