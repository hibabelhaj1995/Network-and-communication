**TASK1: TCPAsk**
Task 1 focuses on developing a TCP client in Java named TCPClient. This client class facilitates communication with a server by establishing a TCP connection, sending data to the server, and receiving its response. The goal is to learn the fundamentals of TCP sockets, implement the client side of client-server communication, and handle any errors that may occur during this process. By using methods like `askServer`, the client can interact with the server in a straightforward and structured manner. A dynamic buffer for receiving data ensures efficient handling of the server's response, while various testing scenarios, such as Daytime and Whois, enable practical validation of the implementation. Finally, a correctly formatted zip file for submission ensures the solution can be evaluated properly.

**TASK2: TCPAsk Connections**
Task 2 extends the TCPClient class introduced in Task 1 to handle different server connection scenarios. It adds options for timeouts, data limits, and controlling connection shutdown. TCPAsk is also updated to support these new parameters. Testing involves interacting with various servers to verify implementation under different conditions. Submission follows the same format as Task 1. Evaluation checks the submission format and functionality through tests.
